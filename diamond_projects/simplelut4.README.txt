This Lattice Diamond project represents a very simple
demo of how to use a lattice FPGA primitive, a look
up table.

The board used is as follows.

* MachX03L
* 6900C

This project is a good proof of concept for incorporating
an FPGA primitive, a 4 digit lookup table, that is provided
by Lattice.

See this install path for the *.vhd file of interest for the
lookup table.

* /usr/local/diamond/3.9_x64/ispfpga/vhdl/data/machxo3l/src
* MACHX03L_LUT.vhd

A pdf for FPGA primitives is as follows.

* FPGALibrariesReferenceGuide31.pdf

This helps the hardware designer in instantiating the
component.

It also serves as demo of LEDs and dipswitches, and the
assignment of particular dipswitches to pins.

Here is the convention used in this project.

* dipswitch down is '0' input
* dipswitch up is '1' input
* LED off indicates a '1' output
* LED on indicates a '0' output

When using the board and loading the bit stream into
SRAM, then view the board with the following convention.

* dipswitch bank to lower left
* LED bank to lower right
* blue led at top

Here is the significant bit convention for the dipswitch
bank and the LED bank.

* left most dipswitch is MSB
* right most dipswitch is LSB
* the right most LED in the LED bank is used as output.
* this single LED is marked as D9.

When all the dipswitch are up, then number 1111 base 2 
is considered as input.  This translates to a logical
1 output via the LUT.  This is because we set the
LUT input output function with a command like this (see
the *.vhd file):

Generic Map (INIT=>b"1100_0000_0000_0000")

Each 1 or 0 in the map indicates the output for that position
in the table.  Our 1111 base 2 corresponds to here:


Generic Map (INIT=>b"1100_0000_0000_0000")
                     ^
                     |

The 1 output comes out as LED D9 in a logical 1 state (which
is LED off).

The dipswitch pattern of (up,up,up,down) yields 1110 based 2.
This translates to an output of 1 via are map and is specified here:


Generic Map (INIT=>b"1100_0000_0000_0000")
                      ^
                      |

All other combinations have an output of logical 0 which results
in the single LED D9 turning on.
