This Lattice Diamond project represents a very simple
adder which will add 3 to the value indicated on the
dip switch.  The result is displayed on the LEDs.

The board used is as follows.

* MachX03L
* 6900C

This project is a good proof of concept for incorporating
LEDs and dipswitches, and the assignment of particular
dipswitches to pins.

Here is the convention used in this project.

* dipswitch down is '0' input
* dipswitch up is '1' input
* LED off indicates a '1' output
* LED on indicates a '0' output

When using the board and loading the bit stream into
SRAM, then view the board with the following convention.

* dipswitch bank to lower left
* LED bank to lower right
* blue led at top

Here is the significant bit convention for the dipswitch
bank and the LED bank.

* left most dipswitch is MSB
* right most dipswitch is LSB
* the right most 5 LEDs in the LED bank are used as output.
* these 5 LEDs are marked are D5 through D9 inclusive.

When all the dipswitch are down, then number 0 is added to
3, which yields a sum of 3.  3 based 10 results in 11 based 2.
The right most two LEDs are off, which indicates 11 based 2.
